So, 

Snapdragon 730: 3 times lower AI performance, slightly slower CPU but somewhat better GPU.
Helio P90: 40\% lower AI performance, slightly slower CPU and the same GPU.
Kirin 810: slightly faster float AI performance and much slower quantized inference, comparable CPU and somewhat faster GPU.
Exynos 9610: was not used in the above comparison due to very poor results - 7 times lower AI performance, much slower CPU, much slower GPU.
