On the charts above, one can see the average inference time and prediction error for several common AI models used in image classification, face recognition, image enhancement and super-resolution tasks. Tiger T710 is generally demonstrating a 30-70\% advantage over Snapdragon 855 Plus in case of float inference, and comparable runtime for quantized models. But when it comes to inference accuracy, Qualcomm's chipset is completely falling behind the Unisoc, showing up to 12 times larger prediction errors in the corresponding tasks. This is something that is not mentioned in any official presentation: there is always a trade-off between the accuracy and the raw inference speed. By adding various specific software optimizations, one can significantly increase the speed of the computations at the cost of significantly degraded precision. Fortunately, Unisoc did not use this trick - Tiger T710 is demonstrating very decent accuracy results in nearly all tests, and thus is clearly getting the first place in both categories.
